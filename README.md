This project, called **Random Generator**, is a web application that provides two primary features:
a **Quiz Generator** and a **Password Generator**. Each tool has its own interactive page, accessible from the main menu.

1. **Quiz Generator**:
2.  This feature allows users to enter the number of participants and desired winners.
3.  After inputting these values, the tool generates random winners, which could be useful for raffles or contests. The results are displayed on the screen.

4. **Password Generator**: This tool helps users create secure passwords.
5. Users can specify the length of the password and select options to include digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.
6. The generated password is displayed on the screen, making it convenient for creating secure, custom passwords.

Each generator page has a simple, user-friendly interface. JavaScript functions handle the randomization logic, 
enhancing the functionality and making the project an example of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together for web-based utilities.
